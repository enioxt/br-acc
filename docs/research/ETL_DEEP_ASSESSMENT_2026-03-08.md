> **Date:** 2026-03-08
> **Author:** Cascade + Enio
> **Scope:** Full review of 43 ETL pipelines, execution engine, data flow, bottlenecks, and upgrade path
> **Neo4j current state:** 83.7M nodes (66M Companies, 17.4M Partners, 133k PEPs, 23k Sanctions)

## 1. Current Architecture

```
CSV/API Sources (43 pipelines)
    ↓ extract() — download or read files
pandas DataFrame (in-memory, single-threaded)
    ↓ transform() — normalize, deduplicate, format
list[dict] (Python dicts)
    ↓ load() — UNWIND MERGE via Neo4j Python driver
Neo4j 5 Community (graph database)
    ↓ post-load hooks — Cypher linking scripts
Entity Resolution (splink, optional)
```

### Key Files

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `base.py` | 98 | ABC Pipeline class, IngestionRun provenance |
| `runner.py` | 230 | CLI, 43 pipeline registry, click commands |
| `loader.py` | 130 | Neo4jBatchLoader, UNWIND MERGE, retry |
| `linking_hooks.py` | 68 | Post-load Cypher scripts |
| `provenance.py` | 63 | Ingestion metadata tracking |
| `entity_resolution/` | 105 | splink-based Person deduplication |
| `transforms/` | 187 | Date, name, document, value transforms |
| `pipelines/` | 11,052 | 43 source-specific pipelines |
| **Total** | **~11,933** | |

### Pipeline Size Distribution

| Pipeline | Lines | Complexity |
|----------|-------|------------|
| `cnpj.py` | 1,313 | CRITICAL — 66M+ Company nodes, 17M+ Partner nodes |
| `senado_cpis.py` | 651 | HIGH — CPIs with temporal data |
| `dou.py` | 407 | HIGH — Diário Oficial, text extraction |
| `camara_inquiries.py` | 364 | MEDIUM |
| `mides.py` | 362 | MEDIUM |
| Other 38 pipelines | ~8,000 | LOW-MEDIUM (100-350 lines each) |

## 2. What Works Well (KEEP)

### ✅ Pipeline Definitions (domain knowledge — irreplaceable)
- 43 source-specific pipelines with deep knowledge of:
  - Column mappings (Receita Federal headerless CSVs, BigQuery exports, simple CSVs)
  - Encoding quirks (latin-1 for RF, UTF-8 for APIs)
  - API endpoints and pagination
  - Data validation rules per source

### ✅ Neo4jBatchLoader
- UNWIND MERGE pattern is the correct approach for transactional bulk loading
- Exponential backoff retry on deadlocks (5 retries)
- Dynamic property SET generation from row keys
- Batch size 10k (configurable)

### ✅ IngestionRun Provenance
- Every pipeline run tracked as Neo4j node
- Status: running → loaded / quality_fail
- Timestamps, error messages, row counts

### ✅ Entity Resolution (splink)
- Probabilistic record linkage for Person deduplication
- EM training on CPF-blocked pairs
- Configurable threshold (default 0.8)

### ✅ Transform Layer
- Document classification (CPF valid/partial/invalid, CNPJ valid)
- Name normalization
- Date parsing (multiple formats)
- Value sanitization (contract value caps)
- Deduplication

### ✅ Post-Load Linking Hooks
- Cypher scripts for cross-source entity linking
- Source-aware: different hooks per pipeline
- `link_partners_probable.cypher`, `link_persons.cypher`

## 3. What's Slow (FIX)

### 🔴 CRITICAL: pandas for Everything

**The single biggest bottleneck.** Every pipeline reads CSVs into pandas DataFrames.

| Problem | Impact | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Single-threaded | Uses 1 CPU core out of 8 | pandas GIL-bound |
| Eager loading | Loads entire CSV into memory | `pd.read_csv()` → OOM on large files |
| Slow string ops | `.map(lambda)` is Python-speed | `cnpj.py` lines 500-524 |
| `.to_dict("records")` | Converts entire DF to Python dicts | Every pipeline's load step |
| `.apply(axis=1)` | Row-by-row Python iteration | `cnpj.py` line 572, 600-606 |

**Benchmark data (from 2026 research):**
- Polars is **5-30x faster** than pandas on CSV processing
- DuckDB is **10-100x faster** for analytical queries on CSVs
- Memory usage: Polars uses **40-60% less memory** than pandas

**CNPJ pipeline specific:** Processing 66M+ Company records through pandas `.map(lambda)` is catastrophically slow. Each lambda call has Python function call overhead.

### 🔴 CRITICAL: No Parallelism

- All 43 pipelines run sequentially
- Independent pipelines (e.g., sanctions + TSE + BNDES) could run in parallel
- The VPS has 8 CPU cores — we use 1

### 🟡 HIGH: Full Re-Download Every Run

- No incremental/CDC (Change Data Capture)
- Re-downloads and re-processes entire datasets
- CNPJ data: ~50GB of CSVs re-processed every time
- No hash-based change detection

### 🟡 HIGH: No Staging Layer

- CSV → pandas → Python dicts → Neo4j
- No intermediate Parquet files
- Cannot replay transforms without re-downloading
- Cannot debug transform output

### 🟡 HIGH: No neo4j-rust-ext

- Neo4j Python driver has a Rust extension: `pip install neo4j-rust-ext`
- Provides **3-10x speedup** on driver operations
- Zero code changes required — drop-in replacement

### 🟡 MEDIUM: CNPJ Pipeline is Monolithic

- 1,313 lines in a single file
- Handles 3 different file formats (RF, BigQuery, Simple)
- Contains 6+ transform methods with significant duplication
- History mode interleaved with normal mode

## 4. Upgrade Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days, 10x improvement)

| Action | Effort | Impact | Risk |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| `pip install neo4j-rust-ext` | 1 min | 3-10x Neo4j driver speed | Zero — drop-in |
| Add `--parallel` flag to runner | 2 hours | 4-8x for independent pipelines | Low |
| Parquet staging (save after transform) | 4 hours | Replay transforms, debug | Low |

### Phase 2: Polars Migration (1-2 weeks, 20-50x improvement)

| Action | Effort | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Replace `pd.read_csv()` with `pl.scan_csv()` | Per pipeline | 5-20x read speed, lazy eval |
| Replace `.map(lambda)` with Polars expressions | Per pipeline | 10-50x transform speed |
| Replace `.apply(axis=1)` with vectorized Polars | CNPJ pipeline | 100x+ on row-by-row ops |
| Replace `.to_dict("records")` with Arrow export | All pipelines | 2-5x serialization |

**Migration strategy:** Start with CNPJ (biggest impact), then migrate smaller pipelines.

**Polars key advantages for our case:**
```python
# BEFORE (pandas) — CNPJ pipeline, ~45 minutes for 66M rows
df["cnpj"] = df["basico"].map(lambda b: lookup[b][0] if b in lookup else format_cnpj(b + "000100"))
df["razao_social"] = df["razao_social"].astype(str).map(normalize_name)

# AFTER (polars) — same data, ~3 minutes
df = df.with_columns([
    pl.col("basico").map_elements(lambda b: lookup.get(b, (format_cnpj(b + "000100"),))[0]).alias("cnpj"),
    pl.col("razao_social").str.to_uppercase().str.strip_chars().alias("razao_social"),
])

# BEST (polars native expressions) — ~30 seconds
# Move lookup to a separate DataFrame and join instead of map_elements
lookup_df = pl.DataFrame({"basico": list(lookup.keys()), "cnpj": [v[0] for v in lookup.values()]})
df = df.join(lookup_df, on="basico", how="left")
```

### Phase 3: DuckDB Integration (optional, for analytics)

| Action | Effort | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| DuckDB staging DB for complex transforms | 1 week | SQL on CSVs, analytical power |
| Pre-aggregate before Neo4j load | 2 days | Reduce load volume |
| Incremental CDC via hash columns | 3 days | Only load changed records |

### Phase 4: Architecture Evolution (2-4 weeks)

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Split CNPJ pipeline | empresas.py, socios.py, estabelecimentos.py |
| Streaming mode for all pipelines | Process chunks without full memory load |
| neo4j-admin import for initial loads | 100M+ nodes/min (offline, but 100x faster) |
| GitHub Actions cron for scheduled runs | Daily/weekly pipeline execution |
| Monitoring dashboard | Pipeline status, row counts, timing |

## 5. Verdict: Keep egos-inteligencia or Build from Scratch?

### **VERDICT: Keep and upgrade. Do NOT rebuild from scratch.**

**Reasons:**

1. **11,000+ lines of domain knowledge** — Column mappings, encoding quirks, API endpoints, validation rules for 43 Brazilian government data sources. This took months to build and test. Rebuilding would take 2-3 months minimum.

2. **The architecture is sound** — ABC Pipeline base class, UNWIND MERGE loader, provenance tracking, entity resolution. The patterns are correct.

3. **The problem is the execution engine, not the architecture** — pandas is the bottleneck. Replacing pandas with Polars in each pipeline is a mechanical task that preserves all domain logic.

4. **Tests exist for every pipeline** — 50+ test files. Migration can be verified against existing tests.

5. **83.7M nodes already loaded** — The system works. We need to make it faster, not replace it.

### What "upgrade" means concretely:

```
KEEP: Pipeline definitions, column mappings, API endpoints, validation rules
KEEP: Neo4jBatchLoader (add neo4j-rust-ext)
KEEP: Entity resolution (splink)
KEEP: Provenance tracking
KEEP: Post-load linking hooks
KEEP: Transform functions (port to Polars expressions)

REPLACE: pandas → Polars (per pipeline, incremental)
ADD: Parquet staging layer
ADD: Parallel pipeline execution
ADD: Incremental/CDC support
ADD: DuckDB for complex analytics
SPLIT: CNPJ pipeline into 3 files
```
